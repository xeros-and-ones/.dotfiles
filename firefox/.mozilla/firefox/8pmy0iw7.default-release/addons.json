Free plan provides 10 GB of data per month (if you confirm your email address), and the Pro plan has unlimited data and access to servers in over 112 cities in 69 countries.\n\nStill not convinced? Perhaps this elegant list of features will convince you otherwise.\n\nStop tracking and browse privately\nGovernments block content based on your location. Corporations track and sell your personal data. Add Windscribe to your browser and take back control of your privacy.\n\nAdvanced Privacy Features\nWindscribe is not just a proxy extension. It's a suite of privacy tools which include:\n\nAd + Tracker Blocking - Ads and trackers follow you around, waste your bandwidth and compromise your privacy. Windscribe will block all this crap.\nMalware Blocking - Some sites distribute malware. We'll prevent you from ever ending up on those sites.\nSocial Blocking - Social networks are the biggest privacy invaders out there. Block their trackers.\nWhitelisting - Our block lists are not one size fits all. Customize your experience.\nLocation API Spoofing - Sites can request your GPS location why bypasses most proxies and VPNs. Not with Windscribe.\nWebRTC Blocking - Prevents WebRTC leaks that plague most proxy extensions and VPNs.\nTimezone Spoofing - Sites can detect that your IP doesn't match your browser's time zone. This feature solves this problem.\nNotification Blocking - Tired for sites asking you to send notifications? We are too. Enable this feature to never see those things again.\nUser Agent Spoofing - Helps combat browser fingerprinting\nCookie Monitoring - Leave nothing behind. This feature deletes 1st or 3rd party cookies when you close the tab.\nLanguage Spoofing - This feature will spoof your browser's language settings to match the proxy location of your choice.\n\nUnlock geo-restricted content\nWindscribe VPN masks your IP address. This gives you unrestricted and private access to entertainment, news sites, and blocked content in over 63 different countries.\n\nNo identifying logs\nYour privacy is a right. We don’t track you. We don't sell your data to marketers, or even share it with anyone. We don’t keep logs that can deanonymize you.\n\nGo beyond basic VPN protection\nFor comprehensive privacy protection even outside of the browser, use our desktop VPN applications (they’re also free). Available for Windows, Mac and Linux. Did we mention mobile? Yeah, there's mobile apps too.\n\n--------------\n\nHaving issues with Windscribe VPN or want to suggest something?

The tags are not really lost, they are still associated with the old URL. This is neither a bug of Bookmarks Organizer nor of Firefox, it's how Firefox works. Please see Bugzilla #1440988 for context.\n\n\nPermissions\n\nBookmarks Organizer needs several permissions to work properly. To give you full transparency this overview also lists “silent“ permissions.\n\nmandatory permissions:\n\nBookmarks Organizer does not work without the following permissions:\n\n- access your data for all sites\n\nThe add-on checks the bookmarks by sending a request to the appropriate URLs. This cannot work without the permission to access these sites.\n\n- read and modify bookmarks\n\nYou installed Bookmarks Organizer for checking and modifying broken bookmarks so it should be clear why the permission is needed to read and modify the bookmarks.\n\n- access browser tabs\n\nThe permission to access the browser tabs is needed so that Bookmarks Organizer can jump to the already opened settings page if the settings page is already opened in another tab and you click the button to open Bookmarks Organizer's settings.\n\nsilent permissions:\n\nBookmarks Organizer needs some more permissions, but Firefox does not prompt for the following permissions:\n\nmenus\n(since 2.0.0)\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an menu entry in the tools menu to access Bookmarks Organizer's user interface.\n\nstorage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that Bookmarks Organizer can store settings and (in the future) bookmark exceptions.","weeklyDownloads":171,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Sören

the number of tabs in each window. Efficient and customizable.","fullDescription":"Tab Counter Plus shows the number of tabs in each Firefox window. It's efficient and customizable.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Can count the number of tabs in each window or among all.\n    Two display modes: SVG text icon or WebExtension badge.\n    Colors and title are customizable.\n    Works with multiple windows side by side (not easy due to WebExtension limitations).\n    Small performance impact. Most other tab counter extensions continuously query all tabs to count them. That's an expensive operation, which Tab Counter Plus avoids by storing the numbers and updating them on various events.\n    Intelligent debouncing. If lots of tabs are opened or closed in a short period of time (e.g. when restoring previous session during startup), the webextension will delay the update of the counter.\n    Very fast. Tab Counter Plus avoids asynchronicity as much as possible in order to achieve a faster update of the counter. In particular, no delay when removing tabs (usual in other tab counter due to WebExtension limitations).\n    Light-weight. Coded in fast vanilla-js, no bloating libraries.\n    I designed and implemented a new WebExtension feature that allows to achieve all the above in a much more robust, simple and efficient way. It's included since Tab Counter Plus version 2.0, targetting Firefox 62.\n\n\nWhy another tab counter add-on?\nThe great Michael Kraft's Tab Counter doesn't work in Firefox Quantum. Some tab counter WebExtensions appeared, but WebExtension limitations made it difficult to create a good tab counter. Therefore, I decided to write my own extension which bypasses the issues as best as I could, and in parallel I started adding new WebExtension features to solve them.","weeklyDownloads":32,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Oriol Brufau","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13595729/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204421.png?modified=1622133046","width":315,"height":301,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204421.jpg?modified=1622133046","thumbnailWidth":315,"thumbnailHeight":301,"caption":"Tab counter using a SVG icon, with popup open."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204419.png?modified=1622133046","width":315,"height":301,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204419.jpg?modified=1622133046","thumbnailWidth":315,"thumbnailHeight":301,"caption":"Tab counter using a WebExtension badge, with popup open."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/204/204420.png?modified=1622133047","width":315,"height":301,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/204/204420.jpg?modified=1622133047","thumbnailWidth":315,"thumbnailHeight":301,"caption":"Tab counter using a SVG icon, with popup closed."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.6579,"reviewCount":24,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tab-counter-plus/reviews/","updateDate":1612649116000},{"id":"{8ad4bea8-ad8d-4e98-b434-a76065dee6cb}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2689/2689074-32.png?modified=e6500cae","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2689/2689074-64.png?modified=e6500cae","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2689/2689074-128.png?modified=e6500cae"},"name":"Prettier Lichess","version":"3.4.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3990379/prettier_lichess-3.4.0.xpi","homepageURL":"https://prettierlichess.github.io/","supportURL":"https://prettierlichess.github.io/","description":"Lichess, but prettier.","fullDescription":"**ALSO IMPORTANT** On export, Firefox will download a file simply title \"Download\".
